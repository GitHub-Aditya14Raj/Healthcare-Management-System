# Healthcare-Management-System
The Healthcare Management System is a comprehensive computer-based application developed using C++. The primary objective of this system is to enhance the efficiency and management of healthcare services. This is achieved by leveraging various data structures to handle and process data in an effective manner.
The system uses arrays for storing patient records, ensuring quick access and easy manipulation of data. Linked lists are employed to manage patient queues, enabling efficient patient scheduling and management. Stacks and queues are utilized in managing real-time healthcare processes such as prioritizing emergency cases in a hospital scenario. Trees and graphs are used in creating a hierarchical structure of the healthcare system and mapping relationships between different entities respectively.
The system is designed with a focus on improving the quality of clinical care. It provides an efficient platform for storing, retrieving, and managing patient data, thereby reducing manual errors and enhancing data accuracy. It also handles appointment scheduling, ensuring smooth operation of the healthcare facility.
In addition to patient management, the system also caters to healthcare professionals. It manages their schedules, specializations, and availability, ensuring efficient allocation and utilization of resources.
This project demonstrates the practical application of data structures in developing robust and efficient systems. It highlights how a well-designed system can significantly improve the quality and delivery of healthcare services. The Healthcare Management System stands as a testament to the potential of computer science in transforming real-world scenarios, making them more efficient and effective.
